# Acquistion-of-Technology
The repository for the Acquistion of Technology mod for Stellaris

This branch has changes to the building files, which alter:
- the values of the amount of jobs given (significantly reduced in almost all effected cases)
- bonuses given (many reductions)
- resource output in select areas
- upkeep (increased in all cases)
- resort & penal colony allowances

A scripted trigger has been added to the appropriate file.  The associated English and French localisation files have been added too.
