# Here you can specify the lists of limits for the number of ships of some types that country can own 
# And potentially the lists of limits for the number of building of some type (not implemented yet)
# Example:
# name_of_ownership_limit = {
#	ship_of_size_limits = {
#		# The list of keys to ship_of_size_limits database
#	}
# 	building_of_type_limit = {
#		# Not implemented yet
#	}
# }
default = {
	ship_of_size_limits = {
		# AOT
		aot_juggernaut_ships_limit
		aot_fe_juggernaut_ships_limit
	}
}
