# To make your mod compatible with BPV - More Building Slots, implement these changes:

# common/scripted_variables/~~BPV_compatibility.txt
# @BPV_compatibility_load = 0
# @BPV_CITY_SLOT = 3
# # end with "#" or empty line

# # common/zones/your_city_zone.txt
# # before:
# max_buildings = 6
# # after:
# max_buildings = @[ BPV_CITY_SLOT * BPV_compatibility_load ]

# common/zones/your_other_zone.txt
# → DO NOT set max_buildings in zone definitions
#   This utilizes default building slot defines that BPVMBS will modify

# # common/districts/your_main_city_district.txt
# # → Only for primary city districts
# # → Append at district end: (preserve original zone_slots)
# inline_script = {

# 	GOVERNMENT  = slot_city_government
# 	SLOT1       = slot_city_01
# 	SLOT_END    = your_slot_city_02
# }
# # This script duplicates END specialization until reaching user-requested counts
