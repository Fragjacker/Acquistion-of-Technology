acot_precursor_databank.4.warbarge: "§EPrecursor Warbarge§!"
acot_precursor_databank.4.enigmalith: "§EPrecursor Enigmalith§!"
acot_precursor_databank.4.gatekeepers: "§EPrecursor Gatekeeper§!"
acot_precursor_databank.4.enigmatic_fortress: "§EPrecursor Enigmatic Fortress§!"

acot_precursor_databank.4.nodata.warbarge: "Ah yes, the old farts space toilet! Or was it the other one? My memory is kinda blurry about this but all I know is that it is very handy for flexing on them plebeian empires.\n\n§HWe need to progress further in the reimagination project to acquire this design!§!"
acot_precursor_databank.4.nodata.enigmalith: "Uhh...it's a megastructure or at least that's what the label says. A space structure to make space resources in space. Also don't wash it with your socks.\n\n§HWe need to progress further in the reimagination project to acquire this design!§!"
acot_precursor_databank.4.nodata.gatekeepers: "Project H.O.D.O.R., what a peculiar name. Apparently this one has to do with doors/gates and ways to hold them, in space of course!\n\n§HWe need to progress further in the reimagination project to acquire this design!§!"
acot_precursor_databank.4.nodata.enigmatic_fortress_platform: "Ah yes, §RThe Fortress§!! The precursors used this to protect their dankest memes and funny xenos footage. The sheer size of it communicates quite well how many memes they must've had back in the day. Or maybe the size itself was a meme too? We'll never know."

acot_precursor_databank.413.desc: "§B$acot_precursor_databank.4.enigmalith$§! The arrival of your post scarcity civilisation is close at hand with this incredibly useful megastructure! All the resources are ours to command!"
acot_precursor_databank.414.desc: "§B$acot_precursor_databank.4.gatekeepers$§! Keeping any kind of gate safe since the dawn of civilisation in this galaxy! This bad boy will help you keeping the nasty neighbours at bay!"
acot_precursor_databank.415.desc: "§B$acot_precursor_databank.4.enigmatic_fortress$§! When simple defense platforms are not enough, this station comes to aid. Equipped with enough fire power and durability to stop entire fleets alone, it will surely come at hand to defend those chokepoints."
acot_precursor_databank.416.desc: "§B$acot_precursor_databank.4.warbarge$§! The space toilet of doom! Bring utter annihilation to your enemies with the comfort of all your species sanitary needs, no matter how far from home you may be!"

### ACTUAL LORE###
acot_precursor_databank.400.a.warbarge.lore: "§BAccording to the data this is the first design of its kind for the ship, that is nowadays known as the §HJuggernaut§! by the younger races.§!"
acot_precursor_databank.400.a.warbarge.data: "The awe inspiring $acot_precursor_databank.4.warbarge$ is fitted with 6 shipyards and significantly more weapon slots then the ordinary Juggernaut, including weapons that are usually mounted on titans.\n\nIn addition the warbarge is drastically more durable for better survivability in hostile territory. All together this makes it probably the best Juggernaut type of ship in existence considering its cost and size."
acot_precursor_databank.400.a.enigmalith.lore: "§BThe data reveals that this structure was key for the self-sustained precursor economies, using the most sophisticated fabrication technologies ever devised.§!"
acot_precursor_databank.400.a.enigmalith.data: "The Enigmalith hosts some of the most advanced autonomous fabrication technology ever created. It is able to create resources in space with marvelous efficiency, to help boosting your economy even further into a new age of prosperity.\n\nIt can be built over pretty much any planet, including ring worlds, to reliably create self-sustaining production hubs in your empire."
acot_precursor_databank.400.a.gatekeepers.lore: "§BThis data reveals the shocking truth. The $acot_precursor_databank.4.gatekeepers$ design was not invented by the precursors themselves but have always kind of existed. This discovery is kind of extraordinary as it implies that there exist or at least existed more powerful empires then the precursors back in the day.§!"
acot_precursor_databank.400.a.gatekeepers.data: "The enormous $acot_precursor_databank.4.gatekeepers$ is probably the largest mass produceable ship in existance. It hosts a plethora of weapon and utility choices to make it fit for any kind of battlefield.\n\nAll in all this makes it the best Titan class ship there exists, considering our current knowledge. It will surely hold the line and any kind of gatesystem, that is of value to us, with great efficiency."
acot_precursor_databank.400.a.enigmatic_fortress_platform.lore: "§RThis fully functional battlestation§! has been used by the precursors for all sorts of defensive purpose, where simple defensive installations did not suffice."
acot_precursor_databank.400.a.enigmatic_fortress_platform.data: "The enigmatic fortress defense platform is probably the strongest defensive station ever designed. Its intricate design allows for far greater firepower then some would expect from the volume of it alone. Due to its sheer size and clever regenerative systems these platforms cannot be destroyed, only disabled and will switch the user should it be defeated in battle."
