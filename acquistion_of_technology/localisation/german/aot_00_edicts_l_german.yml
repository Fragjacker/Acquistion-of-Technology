edict_energize_society: "Zenith Ascendancy: Energize Society"
edict_energize_society_desc: "We have been helpless looking at the decline of our glorious empire for too long. We now have the willpower and the technology to fill the hearts of our people with vitality and energy. Our nation shall rise stronger then ever to face whatever odds the galaxy may throw at us together!\n\n§YEffect:§! Every hedonist in our empire will immediately be unemployed and ready to join the work force of the empire again, should there be available jobs for them. They can also never ever become hedonists again, however the rest of the population still can. Se we may need to re-energize the population a few times until hedonism is gone for good. For the duration of §H20 years§! there cannot spawn any new hedonists either."
