aot_dm_production_core.1.name: "The dawn of post scarcity"
aot_dm_production_core.1.desc: "Since our acquisition of military grade dark matter reactors our scientists have speculated how to furtherly improve their usage in the civilian sector as well. They have come up with a project to examine this possibility thoroughly."
aot_dm_production_core_events.1.a: "Yes, the future will be ours!"
aot_dm_production_core_events.1.a_desc: "We will attempt to study the civilian application of dark matter even further to unlock its full potential."
aot_dm_production_core_postpone: "We don't have the time for this yet, later maybe?"
aot_dm_production_core_postpone_desc: "This project will be postponed for now but will reappear at a later time."
