RESEARCH_ALPHA_POWER: "Reverse Engineer Precursor Databank"
RESEARCH_ALPHA_POWER_DESC: "We can attempt to rebuild the precursor databank from scratch using all information sources possible. Neither deepest depths of the shroud nor other dimensions shall be safe from our gaze to find the clues to make this project happen. This project will require the brightest of minds and highest tech equipment our empire can muster."

RESEARCH_ALPHA_ARTIFACT_POWER: "Reverse Engineer Precursor Databank"
RESEARCH_ALPHA_ARTIFACT_POWER_DESC: "We can attempt to rebuild the precursor databank not completely from scratch but using minor artifacts as a starting point. The arcane knowledge that they provide will help us boosting our chances of success tremendously! However this project will still require the brightest of minds and highest tech equipment our empire can muster."

alpha_diy_events.3.name: "Alpha Project Leader Candidate"
alpha_diy_events.3.desc: "We must select one of our scientists to lead the alpha databank re-assembly project. Due to the volatile nature of our information sources we do not know what could happen during this project. So it is best that the selected candidate have some respectable resume.\n\nSome of our leaders object that it may also be unwise to risk valuable scientists to such untold dangers. We must choose.\n\n§YIt is recommended to chose a scientist with skill level 9 or greater for the highest chance of success.§!\n\n§RPREPARE FOR UNFORSEEN CONSEQUENCES§!"

alpha_diy_events.4.name: "Alpha Artifact Project Leader Candidate"

acot_alpha_diy_fail_desc: "We had the audacity to believe we could beat the §HFallen Empires§! in their own game. Tried being smarter to achieve a feat, that took their ancient civilisation generations of their brightest minds to complete.\n\nNow the §H[Root.GetName]§! stands in the ruins of your own overestimation. We lost the brightest minds that the §H[Root.GetName]§! could muster. Lost tremendous resource and all for nought.\n\n§PIT WAS ALL FOR NOTHING!§!\n\nThe high ambitions of the §H[Root.GetName]§! and all of the §H[Root.Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural]§! have been cut back to size. We sent our best minds and they all §Pfailed§!. We thought they were able and smart enough to conclude this project but we were proven wrong. Maybe we should try again at later time once we improved our leader skill levels.\n\n§YThe project will be terminated for now but we may try again at a later time!§!"

acot_alpha_diy_fail_reconsider_desc: "We tried our best and yet failed. However we can always attempt to take it from others by §Rforce§!, right? This however will permanently lock us out from the option to attempt self-assembly. Proceed?"

acot_alpha_diy_postpone: "We can't deal with this now. Maybe later?"
acot_alpha_diy_postpone_desc: "We can postpone this project for now. Who knows, maybe we can find out new ways to acquire the databank or maybe even build one from scratch? We would need great knowledge and resource for this. \n\nHence we should consider becoming a §HGalactic Ascendancy§!!"

alpha_diy_events.4.desc.f: "Terrible news! Our attempt to re-assemble the precursor databank went haywire! Just as when things were looking to go smoothly. One of the scientists lashed out in anger when he realized that an upcoming game, he was so hyped about will be exclusive to Epoch Games. He smashed the terminal in anger, and accidently activated the facilities self-destruction. The research facility went down in a bright thermonuclear explosion killing all personnel and destroying all research results."
alpha_diy_events.4.desc.g: "Terrible news! Our attempt to re-assemble the precursor databank went haywire! Attempting to replicate the databank AI the research team has accidentally created a rogue AI which referred to itself as SHODANET.

alpha_diy_events.4.desc.h: "Terrible news! Our attempt to re-assemble the precursor databank went haywire! A crucial CPU for the databank was forgotten to add thermal paste. On test activation it immediately reached 100000 degrees causing the spontaneous formation of antimatter. The resulting explosion destroyed the research base and killed the entire research staff!"
alpha_diy_events.4.desc.i: "Terrible news! Our attempt to re-assemble the precursor databank went haywire!

aot_events.1.name: "The End of Decadence"
aot_events.1.desc: "Despite of our best efforts to curtail the rise of hedonism in the §H[Root.GetName]§! it yet proved to be not enough. Today's generation of §H[Root.Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural]§! have never had it so good. The standard of living has never been higher, and many young §H[Root.Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural]§! now grow up in laps of luxury, never experiencing hardship or real struggle. They are conceited, foolish, and have questionable work ethics, favoring of pleasure over work. They take for granted the nation that was built on the bodies of their ancestors, and feel complacent about their way of life, that nothing matters and nothing bad would ever happen. Some young §H[Root.Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural]§! would go so far as to believe that the §H[Root.GetName]§! is invincible because the §H[Root.GetSpeciesAdj]§! race is inherently superior. This development surely will send us towards the spiral of decline that the Fallen Empires have suffered. How could we be so blind not seeing the dangers of their ways?\n\nHowever we know better now. We have evolved beyond what the Fallen Empires once been during their peak time. We now have both the technology and the willpower to fully energize the §H[Root.GetSpeciesAdj]§! saving the §H[Root.GetName]§! from the grim fate of decadence that the Fallen Empires suffered!\n\n§PWe will rise as one. No one is left behind. No one will stand in our way. We are the best of the best, forever.§!"

The construction of the overwhelming §Y$precursor_juggernaut$§! has successfully concluded.\n\nThis is the original design of the watered down version, that the younger races nowadays call §PJuggernauts§!. The §Y$precursor_juggernaut$§! however differs in being not only bigger in size but also focus on durability and direct firepower over carrier operations. The precursors saw no need for just another carrier, when their Battlecruisers host most of their strikecraft and so do we as well. It can also construct up to 6 ships simultaneously and repair ships on the frontline allowing for a ceaseless assault of those who dare to stand against us.\n\nNo one will dare to oppose the §H[Root.Owner.GetName]§! now!"

This mobile space base not only packs dramatic firepower and durability but is also able to build and maintain ships at the frontline of battle, making it a superior threat in any combat scenario.\n\nIt absolutely dwarfs the battle performance of ordinary §YJuggernauts§! and thus is truly the ultimate avatar of space war."
juggevt.2.a: "That was an unwelcome surprise."
