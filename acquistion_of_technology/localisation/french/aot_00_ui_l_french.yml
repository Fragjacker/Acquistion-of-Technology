dm_production_core_ui_guide: "We need to find the optimal energy levels for our £sr_dark_matter£ dark matter production core, which will power our automated industry buildings. The goal is to find a configuration that can run safely and without much maintenance.\n\nOur scientists have devised a prototype, that is ready for testing. However we will need to invest our empires £sr_dark_matter£ dark matter resources for this to succeed.\n\nIt is up to you to decide how much resources you want to allocate. $HMore resources mean potentially faster progress but also higher risk of failure$!. You can dial the reactor power intesity up via the buttons. Once done, hit activate to start the experiment!\n\nIn case of a §Rfailure§! the potential yield will affect the project §Hreactor power level§! negatively. Should the §Hreactor power level§! drop §Rbelow zero§!, the prototype powers down completely and needs to be reconfigured before we can go for another attempt."

aot_dm_production_core_failure_chance_0_tooltip: "The failure chance denotes the risk of a §Hpotential project accident§!. In case of a failure, the §Yestimated yield§! will be substracted from your total energy level. Should the energy level drop below zero, the project will §Rfail§!."

aot_dm_production_core_yield_0: "This is the expected outcome of a successful experiment, which will §Gincrease§! your §Hreactor power level§!. In case of a §Rfailure§! the §Hreactor power level§! will be §Hdecreased§! by the same amount."
aot_production_core_reactor_project_cost_0: "This is the current £sr_dark_matter£ dark matter cost to initiate the project with the currently selected reactor intensity."

aot_dm_production_core_intensity_0: "The current reactor intensity for the prototype experiment. Increase or decrease the intensity via the buttons."

aot_dm_production_core_intensity_up: "Increase the reactor intensity, by adding 2500 £sr_dark_matter£ dark matter to it."
aot_dm_production_core_intensity_down: "Decrease the reactor intensity, by removing 2500 £sr_dark_matter£ dark matter from it."

dm_production_core_energy_required: "Total required §Hreactor power level§!"
dm_production_core_current_energy_amount: "Current §Hreactor power level§!"

aot_dm_production_core_proceed: "Start the experiment with the amount of allocated £sr_dark_matter£ dark matter."
